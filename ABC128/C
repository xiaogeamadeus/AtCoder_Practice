We have N switches with "on" and "off" state, and M bulbs. The switches are numbered 1 to N, and the bulbs are numbered 1 to M.

Bulb i is connected to ki switches: Switch si1, si2, ..., and siki. 
It is lighted when the number of switches that are "on" among these switches is congruent to pi modulo 2.

How many combinations of "on" and "off" states of the switches light all the bulbs?
