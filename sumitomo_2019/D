AtCoder Inc. has decided to lock the door of its office with a 3-digit PIN code.

The company has an N-digit lucky number, S. Takahashi, the president, 
will erase Nâˆ’3 digits from S and concatenate the remaining 3 digits without changing the order to set the PIN code.

How many different PIN codes can he set this way?

Both the lucky number and the PIN code may begin with a 0.
